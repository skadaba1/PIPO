# SMPO: Score-Based Preference Optimization for Protein Fitness Modeling 
Preference tuning protein language models with low N experimental datasets

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For data partitioning using `graph-part`, `mmseqs2` and `emboss` are also required. These are best installed via conda:
```setup
conda install -c bioconda mmseqs2 emboss
```
If you are using Google Colab, the notebook `notebooks/baselines/tm_design_v0_1(LRH).ipynb` contains cells to install these dependencies.

## Training

### Jupyter Notebook Training

The primary training workflow is implemented in Jupyter notebooks. All training was done in Google Colab with an A100 GPU. 

**To train the model(s) in the paper:**

1.  **Setup Environment:**
    *   Ensure all dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed.
    *   If using conda for `mmseqs2` and `emboss`, create and activate your conda environment.
    *   Mount Google Drive if using Colab and your data/models are stored there (as shown in the first cell of the notebook).

2.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Due to the work being under peer review, the specific datasets used in the paper cannot be released at this time.
    *   **Required Data Schema:** Your input CSV files must contain at least two columns:
        *   A column containing the amino acid sequences (e.g., named `Sequence` or `aa_seq`). The sequences should be strings of standard one-letter amino acid codes.
        *   A column containing the corresponding numerical scores/labels (e.g., named `Pred_affinity` or `score`). These scores should be floating-point numbers.

3.  **Model Configuration and Training:**
    *   Execute the cells in `notebooks/baselines/tm_design_v0_1(LRH).ipynb` sequentially.
    *   The notebook contains the complete training pipeline including model setup, data loading, and training loops.

### Standalone Python Training

The repository provides several standalone Python scripts for training:

#### Main Training Script (`core/main.py`)

This script implements the core SMPO (Score-based Preference Optimization) training using DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) with optional MLM (Masked Language Modeling) regularization:

```bash
# Example usage (requires modification of file paths in the script)
cd core
python main.py
```

**Configuration:** Before running, you need to modify the file paths and hyperparameters in `core/main.py`:
- **Line 47:** Update `file_path="/content/ab_library_train.csv"` to your training data path
- **Line 51:** Update `file_path="/content/ab_library_val.csv"` to your validation data path

**Key hyperparameters you can adjust:**
- `lr`: Learning rate (default: 5e-4)
- `batch_size`: Training batch size (default: 8)
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 1)
- `beta`: DPO reward weight (default: 1.0)
- `reg_weight`: MLM regularization weight (default: 0.1)
- `preference_weight`: Label smoothing parameter (default: 0.0)
- `max_length`: Maximum sequence length (default: 250)

The script expects CSV files with columns matching the `TMLibrary` dataset class:
- `Sequence`: amino acid sequences
- `Pred_affinity`: numerical scores

#### Core Trainer Module (`core/trainer.py`)

The trainer module implements the distributed training logic with DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) support:

**Features:**
- **DPO Loss:** Implements preference-based optimization using preferred/non-preferred sequence pairs
- **MLM Regularization:** Optional masked language modeling to maintain protein language understanding
- **Distributed Training:** Supports multi-GPU training via PyTorch DDP
- **Validation:** Built-in validation loop with metric logging to Weights & Biases

**Key methods:**
- `train()`: Main training loop with gradient accumulation
- `process_batch()`: Processes preference pairs and computes DPO + MLM losses
- `validate()`: Validation with logging of reward accuracy and margins

#### Data Partitioning (`graphpart.py`)

Use this script to partition your dataset using homology-based or random splitting:

```bash
# For homology-based partitioning (requires graph-part, mmseqs2, emboss)
python graphpart.py
```

**Functions:**
- `homology_partition(file_path, sequences)`: Creates train/validation/test splits based on sequence similarity using graph partitioning
  - Uses needle alignment algorithm with 50% similarity threshold
  - Splits: 80% train, 15% test, 5% validation
  - Requires `graph-part` package and alignment tools

- `split_and_save_dataframe(df, train_ratio=0.8, val_ratio=0.05, test_ratio=0.15)`: Creates random splits
  - Shuffles data with fixed random seed (42) for reproducibility
  - Saves splits to separate CSV files
  - Option to filter unbounded values

**Usage Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from graphpart import split_and_save_dataframe

# For random splitting
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")
train_df, val_df, test_df = split_and_save_dataframe(
    df, 
    train_file='train.csv', 
    val_file='val.csv', 
    test_file='test.csv'
)

# For homology-based splitting (requires sequences list)
sequences = df['Sequence'].tolist()
homology_partition("your_data.csv", sequences)
```

## Evaluation

### Sequence Evolution Evaluation (`evaluation/sequence_evolution.py`)

This script implements directed evolution simulation using the trained model to evolve protein sequences toward higher fitness scores:

```python
# After setting global variables
evolved_seq, final_score, generations = evolve(
    'EEEIRTTNPVATEQYGMSPYGLLGRLEA', 
    num_children=500, 
    max_generations=20
)
```

#### Advanced SMPO Notebook (`tm_design_v0_2.ipynb`)

This notebook implements **Score-based Preference Optimization (SMPO)** using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for improved protein fitness prediction.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

   - Mount Google Drive
   - Install dependencies including transformers, wandb, graph-part
   - Install bioinformatics tools if using homology partitioning

2. **Data Preparation** (Enhanced for preference learning)

                        rank=8, num_layers=model_size[0], dropout_rate=0.05)
   
   # Reference model (frozen copy of original model)
   ref_model = freeze_model(EsmForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint))
   
   # SMPO-specific hyperparameters
   beta = 1.0  # DPO reward scaling parameter (higher = more aggressive preference learning)
   reg_weight = 0.5  # MLM regularization weight (0.1-0.5 recommended)
   preference_weight = 0.1  # Label smoothing for preference learning
   gradient_accumulation_steps = 8
   print_interval = 100
   ```

4. **DPO Training Configuration**
   ```python
   # Key SMPO training parameters
   lr = 5e-4  # Learning rate 
   batch_size = 8  # Smaller batch size due to preference pairs
   epochs = 1  # Usually 1 epoch is sufficient for DPO fine-tuning
   max_length = 250  # Maximum sequence length
   
   # Multi-layer perceptron for adaptive beta scaling (optional)
   mnn = torch.nn.Sequential(
       torch.nn.Linear(1, 16),
       torch.nn.ReLU(),
       torch.nn.Linear(16, 1),
       torch.nn.Sigmoid()
   ).to(device)
   ```

5. **Training Loop Execution**

         epochs=epochs, 
         beta=beta, 
         reg_weight=reg_weight, 
         preference_weight=preference_weight, 
         print_interval=print_interval)
   ```

6. **Model Evaluation & Analysis**
   ```python

   # Expected RÂ² improvement: ~0.55 (SFT) â 0.63 (SMPO)
   ```

7. **Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) Analysis** (Optional)
   ```python
   # Train SAE for interpretability analysis
   sae = SparseAutoencoder(input_dim=hidden_dim, latent_dim=256)
   trained_sae = train_sae(sae, activations, num_epochs=50, lr=5e-4)
   
   # Save SAE for later analysis
   torch.save(sae.state_dict(), '/content/drive/MyDrive/sae_SMPO_model.pth')
   ```

### Key Configuration Notes

**Data Format Requirements:**
- **For SFT:** CSV with `Sequence` and numerical score columns
- **For SMPO:** Same format, but TMLibrary class automatically creates preference pairs based on score rankings

**Memory Optimization:**
- Use gradient accumulation (8 steps recommended) for larger effective batch sizes
- Reduce `max_length` if experiencing OOM errors
- Consider using smaller model variants (ESM-2 8M or 35M) for prototyping

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- **Beta (Î²):** Controls preference learning strength (0.1-1.0, higher = more aggressive)
- **reg_weight:** MLM regularization strength (0.1-0.5, prevents catastrophic forgetting)
- **Learning rate:** 5e-4 works well, reduce to 1e-4 for more stable training
- **LoRA rank:** 8 provides good balance of efficiency and expressiveness

**Expected Training Times:**
- **SFT (50 epochs):** 2-4 hours on A100 GPU
- **SMPO (1 epoch):** 1-2 hours on A100 GPU
- **SAE training:** 30-60 minutes additional

**Troubleshooting:**
- **OOM errors:** Reduce batch size, max_length, or use gradient checkpointing
- **Diverging loss:** Reduce learning rate or beta parameter
- **Poor convergence:** Increase training epochs or adjust scheduler parameters

**Results Reproduction:**
- Use the exact hyperparameters specified in the notebooks
- Ensure proper data partitioning (homology-based recommended)
- Run multiple seeds and report average performance
- Expected results: SFT RÂ² â 0.55, SMPO RÂ² â 0.63
